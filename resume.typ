== About Me

I am a passionate and seasoned Software Architect/Engineer with a diverse skill set, boasting extensive experience across various programming languages and technologies. My active contributions to numerous GitHub repositories highlight my commitment to open-source collaboration.

My proficiency spans a wide spectrum, with a strong focus on building (micro)services, predominantly in Rust & Python. My recent interests revolve around the Rust programming language, WebAssembly, and distributed software, reflecting my continuous quest for innovation.

My capabilities encompass the entire software development lifecycle, from architecting and coding to deployment, autoscaling, and maintenance. I have successfully created server-side (.py, .rs), browser-side (.js, .ts, .wasm), and infrastructure (using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, and CDK) solutions. My portfolio includes the development of GraphQL, RPC, and RESTful microservices in Python and Rust, as well as crafting JavaScript frontends with Ember and React. I'm well-versed in DevOps pipelines and have experience in building an End-to-End Test Automation Framework (both horizontal and vertical) using RobotFramework. I've also ventured into the creation of native iOS apps, managed Android and iOS device farms, and even built a Raspberry Pi Bitcoin mining farm with custom ASIC chips.

My expertise covers the entire web application stack, from server-side to browser-side, and extends from architecture to scaling. I have a proven track record of scaling high-traffic web applications and deploying services on major cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. My toolbox includes tools like Fabric, Docker, AWS Copilot, Kubernetes, and more.

Beyond my technical skills, I have a strong leadership background, effectively guiding small tech teams to success and fostering a positive work environment. I've also made significant contributions to open-source projects and indulged in reverse-engineering and 'hacking' mobile applications as a passionate pursuit.

Outside my professional life, I remain committed to exploring new technologies and staying abreast of the latest software engineering trends. I relish engaging in philosophical discussions and delving into topics related to socio-economic and political change. In my leisure time, I enjoy tinkering with IoT and robotic projects alongside my kids, combining fun with continuous learning and skill development.
